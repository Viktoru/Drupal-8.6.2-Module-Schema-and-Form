# Drupal-8.6.2-Module-Schema-and-Form
This is a Module - D8: Schema and Form

This is a very simple schema module. It will create a table with the following columns:
pid; uid; name; surname; and age.

I have included some data to test it. 

Finally, I have a form to insert data. Eventually, I will add the rest of the code to insert and update the data.
